# Generating-Knowledge-Graph-Using-AllenNLP
This is for store scource code of master's final year project.



Two .ipynb file are source codes.




Two text files are the dataset used here.


All codes done used Python3 and ran on Jupyter Notebook.

Before run these codes, libraries are needed install, such as AllenNLP, NumPy, SpaCy, Sense2Vec.

Then run the code, row by row on any python3 environment. Store the text file with code in the same file.

For the MSR dataset, the running time will take hours (I used about 7 hours).

For the other text file, the extracting spped will be out immidiately.

5 csv files are the results of msr-data.
